## day's ideas

### hashing the tiles
* early dev idea but take it further
* hash the fill or not fill values into binary numbers
* use those for adjacency checking

### structure investigation
* diagram was made while investigating the way that objects were creating, initialising, and referencing each other
* notice the spaghetti
* the plan was to copy the way we generate tiles from the way rooms handle them and refactor it later
    * this quickly became a lot of work for something that was already planned to be redone later
