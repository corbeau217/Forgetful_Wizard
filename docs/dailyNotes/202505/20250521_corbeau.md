## day's ideas

### separate editor projects

#### tile set viewer / decypherer
* viewer for tilesets
* could have code to automatically fetch the shapes and create the prefabs?
    * this would depend on unity's prefab system and whether it lets us create them at run time
    * might need to just create a scriptable object which prepares the 'runtime' prefab for instantiation
* would allow viewing how tilesets interact with one another

#### mask painter
* purely for pixel painting grid masks
* would need to learn how to write a texture out to file

#### tilemap editor
* similar to the mask painter but it would be for tile placement in 3D
* could use an interface much like various grid city building/simulation games
* generates masks to match the tilemap and writes them to file

### separate generation scenes

#### grid mask reconciller
* creates sprites in draw order matching the grid layer priority which is scanned by orthographic camera in to a render texture
* would then allow us to verify how it's reconciling the tiles correctly
* could show diagnostic information about tiles without using the shapes themselves (purely sprite based)
* dividing hue spectrum into equal parts for each different tileset used
* no longer using magnitude but just checking each colour channel is similar enough to the desired colour

#### single sprite, multi texture shader
* using fragment shader to reconcile layers so we dont have to do extra overhead of rendering the rest of the scene
* likely would have limited texture count but we could use something similar to inode structure and do indirect/double indirect/triple indirects

#### grid renderer / tile map tester
* to test the tilemap system outside of the game world
* allows for menus dedicated to diagnostic information
* could allow changing or updating the tilemap at runtime

### alternate tileset schemes
* allowing for alternative tileset styles? where it might be only corners or only fills
* could just use the standard one still but recoloured?
* something to say whether a tile is legal or not

### issues with tile layer generation
* uses extra layers but stops adding when it finds a higher priority
* currently just draws all layers over the top of each other
* needs a way to merge layers?

### interactable object
* box collider for trigger
* has over head sprite "open?" / "activate?"
* has behaviour script for what to do
