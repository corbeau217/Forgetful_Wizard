## day's ideas

### filler books
* spamming out literary works as they're thought of
* filler for random books found
* some are damaged with only part of the book being readable or partial translations from a forgotten language
* diary entries as well

### spell forge
* spell forge thingy for making new spells
    * costs a lot of resources to make specific spells
    * random spells are cheaper
* need materials to make a spell
* random spells could give you more information on the spell initially
* penmanship for mistakes making bad spells by accident
* spell attributes/components are unknown to new wizards
    * roguelike element comes from discovering more spell components?
    * lets you make better spells to start of with on the next run
* animation based on type and effect

### game generation

#### grid generation
* can runtime create the collection to house secondary cells
* could even separate collections per layer/cell generation type

#### interactible generation
* this behaviour is added to existing object
* creates sub object holding the box collider/tooltip management/interaction event

#### room generation

##### generation ordering 

1. base primary grid fill (grid background)
2. subtractive primary shape (movement)
    1. passage
    2. general shape
3. additive primary shape (movement)
    1. nooks/room shape modifications
    2. pillars
4. additive primary ornaments (movement)
    1. shelves
    2. torches
5. tertiary grid region allocation
    * scans primary grid for suitable locations
    * adds region that interactables can spawn
        - perhaps location added to a queue
        - has spawn types added to the region
6. interactables
    * spawns things for each of the registered locations
        1. chests
        2. books
        3. npcs
        4. enemies
        5. extra decorations

##### generation structuring
* ornament tiles need to learn about the connectivity and must work around it
* should have floors be separate to the wall generation
    * allows them to influence wall generation
    * lets us use floor tile patterns

#### room collition mesh
* collision mesh could be separate to the walls?
    * height map style and then constructing a shape from it
    * less likely to catch on edges and faster collision detection
    * can also have separate collision meshes for layers
    * lets players pass through bookshelves
    * kind of terrain looking mesh but invisible

#### book shelf generation
* book shapes be textures/fragment shader hacks
* could generate a stream of them at the start of that game instance
    * keeps it fresh
* using existing textures to create the new textures
    * drawing spines with height maps
    * generate the normal maps
    * constructs texture by stacking books on a shelf
* could use physics engine to place books
    * maybe their pages can open and crumple?
    * some fall on floor so it's projected on to the floor
        * these should be kickable though
        * feels weird to not be able to search/ interact with them
* generate interaction mapping when the render texture of the shelf is made
    * allows for investigation
    * menu for searching when sanctuary / safe area 
        * hand from bottom of screen
        * perhaps for when in an area that the books are owned or every book is important
    * alternative searching is rummaging
        * depends on how many books and nearby hostiles
        * when there's lots of junk books?
        * could be a faster way to search and ignores filler books
        * maybe it has a small chance to miss books
    * filler books might be in other languages
        * conlangs and gibberish
        * other real languages
        * could even search for public domain/free to use books
* placeholder is that only interactable books are coloured in
    * grid for shelf?
    * regex of book location `/r(?<row>[0-2][0-9])c(?<column>[0-2][0-9])s(?<shelf>[0-1])p(?<place>[0-9])/`
        * `r00c00s0p0` to `r29c29s1p9`
        * `r` row of the room
        * `c` column of the room
        * `s`the shelf of that bookshelf
        * `p` placement on the shelf

#### primary / secondary grid shenanigans
* cell renderers are for secondary cells at present, so using the same structure for room generation has concerns
* likely need to make our own grid making system to get around this and specify in `GridGeneratorSettings` the style of grid generation to use

### vlogging updates

#### recording clips
* simple recordings of the game/other games in progress
* text written/typed for over the frames while it plays with only game sounds
* wont need to worry about vocal spookies
* could speak over it and use voice filter but this is suss and could be reversed
* phonetics based voice over using monotonous limited samples?

### puzzles and challenges

* what if the game isnt to accumulate but to learn how to make for the scenario
* some things arent accessible with the spells you know
* later you learn how to do the things that let you get past a scenario
* as you get close to the door to the outside, monsters/npcs increase in strength to encourage survivability
* scaling monsters based on how fast the player can kill them
* players able to do lots of damage really fast get more variety of monsters with varying skills
* teaching the player to change blink to a long cooldown high cost to cross an expanse
    * eventually it's a tear in space that opens
    * higher power have longer wind ups
    * eventually reciting enchantments to travel across the map
    * compressed map information for larger distances
    * saving the changes made
    * corpses dissolve in to environment to garbage collect
