## day's ideas

### prototyping

#### levels and rooms
* focusing on making some rooms that are meant to prepare the player for the rest of the game
* not that procedural
* explore the system
* maybe even rigid meshes

#### spells
* limiting the spell pool to start with and then leaving the spell customisation as a later unlock
* perhaps they have to beat the game to unlock the spell forge
* maybe once they relearn how to read the sigils they can make spells
    * replayability note, maybe sigils are randomly generated per life
    * they change each time and over multiple games, but there's tools available to help them learn the spells
    * people that learn how to dictionary attack can find sigils faster
    * maybe the more they play, their "soul notes" record the frequency they find different sigils so they can start trying to translate them
* maybe the point is to try and translate sigils as you find them, figuring out what they are
    * some books confirm what they are
    * some npcs confirm them
    * guessing and using the spell could let you know
    * "soul notes" you could record what spells are and check how often you find them

#### spell creation is creative mode
* extra game mode separate from store about endless survival rather than puzzles and learning
* you get the choice of a sigil to take, and can make spells using known sigils between waves
* generic dungeon crawling levels and rooms
* unlocked when the player beats the story/dies after first boss?
* finding sigils in story unlock them for endless mode?
* collection while giving them the power of experimenting and learning
* monsters seen in story mode unlock them for endless mode
* endless mode could be a dream/astral plane/dimensional walking during a trance
